# TempMap
The plug-in allows to apply spatial analytical modelling based on a hybrid interpolation and is here applied to the CAPITOUL atmospheric database of Toulouse (France), the MApUCE urban database and the topographical information from the French National Geographical Institute to obtain air temperature maps for four Local Weather Types.This plug-in works only with qgis 2.14 and Qqgis 2.18. A new version in python 3 is under development. 

Plugin Builder Results

Your plugin TempMap was created in:
    C:\Users\thoma\.qgis2\python\plugins\TempMap

Your QGIS plugin directory is located at:
    C:/Users/thoma/.qgis2/python/plugins

What's Next:

  * Copy the entire directory containing your new plugin to the QGIS plugin
    directory

  * Compile the resources file using pyrcc4

  * Run the tests (``make test``)

  * Test the plugin by enabling it in the QGIS plugin manager

  * Customize it by editing the implementation file: ``temp_map.py``

  * Create your own custom icon, replacing the default icon.png

  * Modify your user interface by opening TempMap.ui in Qt Designer

  * You can use the Makefile to compile your Ui and resource files when
    you make changes. This requires GNU make (gmake)
